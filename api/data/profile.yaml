bio: |
  I'm a software engineer with a unique background in education. Originally from Cape Town, 
  South Africa, I moved to Chicago in 2012. After several years as a teacher in Chicago 
  Public Schools, I transitioned into tech - first coaching entry-level engineers at a startup, 
  and now building cloud integration solutions and autonomous agentic workflows at SAIC.
  
  My current focus is on building effective, customer-centric web applications and exploring 
  how AI agents can solve real problems for users. I spend a lot of time working with LLMs, 
  agent SDKs, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients and servers.

interests:
  - Building autonomous agentic workflows
  - AI/LLM integration and prompt engineering
  - Clean architecture and best practices
  - Performance optimization
  - Mentoring and coaching developers

preferred_stack:
  - Vite with TypeScript
  - React with Tailwind CSS
  - OpenAI SDK for AI integration
  - Anthropic MCP SDK for Model Context Protocol
  - PostgreSQL for production databases
  - SQLite for rapid development
